# JamBox


## Linux (tested with Debian)

### Installing VLC
1. Update the Package Index
Open your terminal and run:
sudo apt update

If you only need the VLC player libraries (runtime only):
sudo apt install libvlc5 libvlccore9

If you also need development headers for building applications with VLC:
sudo apt install libvlc-dev
