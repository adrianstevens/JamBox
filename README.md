## Linux (tested with Debian)

### Installing VLC

#### Update the Package Index

Open your terminal and run:

```
sudo apt update
```

If you only need the VLC player libraries (runtime only):

```
sudo apt install libvlc5 libvlccore9
```

If you also need development headers for building applications with VLC:

```
sudo apt install libvlc-dev
```
